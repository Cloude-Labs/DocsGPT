# Assets: T-Shirt for Successful Pull Requests

Welcome to the Docsgpt repository! We're excited to offer a cool incentive for your contributions to our documentation. For every successful pull request you make, you can earn a stylish Docsgpt T-shirt. 

Certainly, I've updated the "How it Works" section to reflect that pull requests can be created for contributions in various areas, including code and documentation. Here's the revised section:

## How it Works

Getting your hands on one of these awesome T-shirts is easy. Just follow these simple steps:

1. **Contribute**: You can create pull requests not only for issues but for anything you want to contribute, whether it's code, documentation, or any other valuable addition to our project.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Create a new branch, make your edits, add new content to the documentation, or contribute code, and then push your changes to your forked repository.

4. **Create a Pull Request**: Go back to the original repository, and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Compare the changes between your branch and the main branch, write a brief description, and submit your pull request.

5. **Review and Merge**: Our team will review your pull request. If it's accepted and merged into the main repository, you're eligible for a T-shirt!

6. **Claim Your Swag**: Once your pull request is merged, we'll reach out to you for your shipping details. We'll send you one of our awesome Docsgpt T-shirts as a token of our appreciation for your contribution.

## T-shirt Design

Our T-shirts are designed with the Docsgpt logo and a stylish, comfortable fit. Here's a sneak peek of what you'll be getting:

## Terms and Conditions

- T-shirt eligibility is subject to our discretion, and we reserve the right to decline the swag in case of incomplete or low-quality contributions.
- One T-shirt per successful pull request. Multiple contributions are encouraged and appreciated, but we can only send one T-shirt per user.
- Make sure your contributions are aligned with our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and do not violate any copyright or licensing agreements.

We're excited to see your contributions to Docsgpt's documentation, and we hope you enjoy your T-shirt as a token of our gratitude for helping us improve our project.
