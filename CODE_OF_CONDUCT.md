# Code of Conduct: Contributor Covenant

## Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, wholeheartedly commit to creating a welcoming and 
harassment-free community for all, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disabilities, 
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, 
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our pledge is to engage with one another in a manner that fosters openness, inclusivity, diversity, 
and the overall well-being of our community.

## Our Ethical Standards

Behaviors that foster a positive and enriching environment within our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward fellow community members and contributors alike.
* Respecting and embracing diverse opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Providing and graciously accepting constructive feedback.
* Taking responsibility and offering apologies to those affected by our mistakes, while also
  learning from those experiences.
* Prioritizing the greater good of the community over individual interests.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
* Any kind of harassment, whether public or private.
* Sharing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their consent.
* Any type of conduct that would be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Duties And Responsibilities

Community leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of clarifying and upholding our standards 
of acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate corrective actions in response to any 
behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and duty to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki 
edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and they will 
communicate the reasons for their moderation decisions when necessary.

## Scope And Applicability

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and extends to instances where an individual 
officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an 
official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed 
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Incidents of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community 
leaders responsible for enforcement at contact@arc53.com. All complaints will be promptly and fairly 
reviewed and investigated.

Community leaders are bound to respect the privacy and security of the individual reporting any kind of 
incident.
