## Project structure

- Application - Flask app (main application).

- Extensions: The Chrome extension.

- Scripts - Script that creates similarity search index for other libraries.

- Frontend: The frontend, which utilizes Vite and React.

## Getting Started

Please ensure that you have Docker installed.

If you are using Mac OS or Linux, follow these steps:

`./setup.sh`

This will install all the necessary dependencies and provide the option to either download the local model or utilize OpenAI. 

Alternatively, consult this guide:

1. Download and open this repository with `git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git`
2. Create a `.env` file in your root directory and set the env variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and `VITE_API_STREAMING` to true or false, depending on whether you want streaming answers or not.
   It should look like this inside:

   ```
   API_KEY=Yourkey
   VITE_API_STREAMING=true
   ```
   
   See optional environment variables in the [/.env-template](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/.env-template) and [/application/.env_sample](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/application/.env_sample) files.

3. Run [./run-with-docker-compose.sh](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/run-with-docker-compose.sh).
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/.

To stop, just run `Ctrl + C`.





## Development environments

### Spin up mongo and redis
For development, only two containers are used from [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) (by deleting all services except for Redis and Mongo). 
See file [docker-compose-dev.yaml](./docker-compose-dev.yaml).

Run
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml build
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d
```

### Run the backend

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or 3.11 installed.

1. Export the necessary environment variables or prepare a `.env` file within the `/application` folder:
   - Copy the contents of[.env_sample](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/application/.env_sample) and create `.env` with your OpenAI API token for the `API_KEY` and `EMBEDDINGS_KEY` fields.

    (check out [`application/core/settings.py`](application/core/settings.py) for additional configuration options.)

2. (optional) Create a Python virtual environment:
   You can follow the [Python official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for virtual environments.

a) On Mac OS and Linux
```commandline
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
b) On Windows
```commandline
python -m venv venv
 venv/Scripts/activate
```

3. Change to the `application/` subdir by the command `cd application/` and install dependencies for the backend:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the app using `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=7091`.
5. Start worker with `celery -A application.app.celery worker -l INFO`.

### Start frontend 

Ensure that your Node version is 16 or a more recent one.

1. Navigate to the [/frontend](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/frontend) folder.
2. Install the required packages `husky` and `vite` (ignore if already installed).

```commandline
npm install husky -g
npm install vite -g
```

3. Install dependencies by running `npm install --include=dev`.
4. Run the app using `npm run dev`.
