## Project structure

- Application - Flask app (main application).

- Extensions - Chrome extension.

- Scripts - Script that creates similarity search index and stores for other libraries. 

- Frontend - Frontend uses Vite and React.


## QuickStart

Note: Make sure you have Docker installed

On Mac OS or Linux, write:

`./setup.sh`

It will install all the dependencies and allow you to download the local model or use OpenAI.

Otherwise, refer to this Guide:

1. Download and open this repository with `git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git`

2. Create a `.env` file in your root directory and set the env variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key and  `VITE_API_STREAMING` to true or false, depending on if you want streaming answers or not.
   It should look like this inside:

   ```bash
   API_KEY=Yourkey
   VITE_API_STREAMING=true
   ```

You can create this file manually using a text editor or use a command-line text editor like `echo` in Windows Command Prompt:

   ```bash
   echo API_KEY=Yourkey > .env 
   echo VITE_API_STREAMING=true >> .env
   ```

See optional environment variables in the `/.env-template`  and`/application/.env_sample` files.

3. Run the following command to set up the project and start the application: 

   ```bash
   ./run-with-docker-compose.sh
   ```

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). 

To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal or Command Prompt. 


## Development environments


### Spin up mongo and redis

For development, only two containers are used from `docker-compose.yaml` (by deleting all services except for Redis and Mongo). 
See file [docker-compose-dev.yaml](./docker-compose-dev.yaml).

Run the following commands:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml build
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d
```

### Run the Backend

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or 3.11 installed.

1. Export required environment variables or prepare a `.env` file in the `/application` folder. You can create a `.env` file using Windows Command Prompt like this:

   ```bash
   echo API_KEY=Yourkey > .env
   echo EMBEDDINGS_KEY=YourEmbeddingsKey >> .env
   ```

Replace `Yourkey` and `YourEmbeddingsKey` with your actual API keys.

(check out [`application/core/settings.py`](application/core/settings.py) if you want to see more config options.)

2. (optional) Create a Python virtual environment:

```commandline
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate    # On linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Change to the `application/` subdir and install dependencies for the backend:

```commandline
pip install -r application/requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app using the following command:

   ```bash
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=7091
   ```

5. Start the worker with the following command:

   ```bash
   celery -A application.app.celery worker -l INFO
   ```


### Start frontend 

Make sure you have Node version 16 or higher.

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` folder.

2. Install dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   

3. Run the app using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
