## 🐞 Issues and Pull requests

- We value contributions in the form of discussions or suggestions. We recommend taking a look at existing issues and our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/arc53/projects/2).

- If you're interested in contributing code, here are some important things to know:

- We have a frontend built on React (Vite) and a backend in Python.

### If you are looking to contribute to frontend (⚛️React, Vite):

- The current frontend is being migrated from [`/application`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/application) to [`/frontend`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/frontend) with a new design, so please contribute to the new one.
- Check out this [milestone](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/milestone/1) and its issues.
- The Figma design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/OXLtrl1EAy885to6S69554/DocsGPT?node-id=0%3A1&t=hjWVuxRg9yi5YkJ9-1).

Please try to follow the guidelines.

### If you are looking to contribute to Backend (🐍 Python):

- Review our issues and contribute to [`/application`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/application) or [`/scripts`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/scripts) (please disregard old [`ingest_rst.py`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/scripts/old/ingest_rst.py) [`ingest_rst_sphinx.py`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/scripts/old/ingest_rst_sphinx.py) files; they will be deprecated soon).
- All new code should be covered with unit tests ([pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)). Please find tests under [`/tests`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/tests) folder.
- Before submitting your Pull Request, ensure it can be queried after ingesting some test data.
